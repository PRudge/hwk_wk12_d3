# Polymorphism & Composition Homework - Quiz

# Polymorphism

1. What does the ___word___ 'polymorphism' mean? 


```Polymorphism means many forms. It is used in relation to inheritance. for example a car can be in array of cars with car attributes but can also become a vehicle and only have vehicel attributes ``` 


2. What does it mean when we apply polymorphism to OO design? Give a simple Java example.


```It is used in relation to inheritance. for example a car can be in array of cars with car attributes but can also become a vehicle and only have vehicel attributes ``` 

3. What can we use to implement polymorphism in Java?

``` Inheritance/Abstract classes ```

4. How many 'forms' can an object take when using polymorphism?

```An infinite number ```

5. Give an example of when you could use polymorphism.

``` If we wanted to create an aircraft hangar full of differnent types of planes, the super class would be plane and we would have an array of planes (of different types but still all planes) ```



# Composition

6. What do we mean by 'composition' in reference to object-oriented programming?

``` Composition in java is the design technique to implement has-a relationship in classes ```

7. When would you use composition? Provide a simple example in Java. 

``` When several classes have the same method, it gives us a way of reusing the code, for example in a computer with components the monitor, and screen have an output we can use composition ```

8. What is/are the advantage(s) of using composition?

```The ability to reuse code ```

9. When an object is destroyed, what happens to all the objects it is composed of?

``` All the objects are destroyed too ```
